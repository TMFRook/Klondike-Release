          Welcome to Klondike, the <a href="http://nuget.org/">NuGet</a> repository
          for caching public packages and storing your private packages privately.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <p>To use this repository from Visual Studio, add a new Package Source using this URL:</p>

        <div id="package-source-placeholder"></div>

        <p>Alternatively, you can add the package source from the command line as follows:</p>

        <div id="package-source-command-placeholder" data-package-source-name="Klondike"></div>

        <h2>Wait, What is this Thing?</h2>
        <p>
          Do you know what the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa496123.aspx">.NET Framework</a> is?
          Do you know what NuGet is? No? If not, you can probably stop reading now. Instead perhaps do some
          research on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?safe=off&amp;q=monkey+riding+dog">
          monkeys riding dogs</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Klondike is similar to the <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Server/">NuGet.Server project</a>
          that lets you host a package feed on your own private network. Klondike is different because it's
          faster. Way faster. The problem with NuGet.Server is that it slows down to a crawl after you add around
          100 packages. Klondike uses <a href="https://github.com/themotleyfool/Lucene.Net.Linq">Lucene.Net.Linq</a>
          to index your projects to give you all the searchy goodness of Lucene along with super fast package
          retrieval.
        </p>
        <h2>You Should Use Klondike if...</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You develop software with Microsoft.NET or the Mono Framework</li>
          <li>You use NuGet</li>
          <li>You don't want your build to break when <a href="http://nuget.org">nuget.org</a> goes down, or</li>
          <li>You create packages for private consumption, or</li>
          <li>You want a place to push packages to test them before releasing to nuget.org</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You should not use Klondike if you are not awesome.
